# Welcome!

This Swift template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example using Swift Package Manager and XCTest. If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.


The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.

# Hands-on Demo

@[Luke, how many stars there are in these galaxies?]({"stubs": ["src/main/java/com/yourself/Universe.java"], "command": "com.yourself.UniverseTest#test"})

Check out the markdown file [`welcome.md`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md) to see how this exercise is injected into the template.

# Template Resources

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)  
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`java-project`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/tree/master/java-project)  
A simple Java + Maven + JUnit project dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](/doc/reference-runner).


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/blob/master/techio.yml)  
This *mandatory* file describes both the table of content and the programming project(s). The file path should not be changed.


# Visual and Interactive Content

Tech.io provides all the tools to embed visual and interactive content like a Web app or a Unix terminal. Please refer to the [documentation](/doc) to learn more about the viewer integrations.
